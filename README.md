Predicting who wins professional tennis matches.

Instead of a typical ELO approach, I've decided to try treating match win prediction as a binary classification problem. I took the statistics available for each match from Jeff Sackmann's github, then anonymyzed the matches such that only the statistics are predictors. Other considerations, such as head-to-head statistics, were also included. 

An incredible amount of credit goes to Jeff Sackmann and this repository https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp
